# Overlay Python
Counting and drawing overlay portions of image

### Requirements:
* You must have atleast Python 2.7 installed. (Created under 2.7.10)
* You must have Python Imaging Library installed. Get it here: www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

### How to:
* Look in the source code and add the address of the files in the list "fileList"
* Add the destination, where to save the final output file in the "output" variable located in third last line.
* Run the program using your favourite technique.

### Limitations:
* Time consuming
* Currently supports overlaying of 15 layers, due to lack of ideas of color :P


Suggestions are welcome.
